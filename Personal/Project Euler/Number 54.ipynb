    "In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "* High Card: Highest value card.\n",
    "* One Pair: Two cards of the same value.\n",
    "* Two Pairs: Two different pairs.\n",
    "* Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value.\n",
    "* Straight: All cards are consecutive values.\n",
    "* Flush: All cards of the same suit.\n",
    "* Full House: Three of a kind and a pair.\n",
    "* Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value.\n",
    "* Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.\n",
    "* Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.\n",

    "If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.\n",
