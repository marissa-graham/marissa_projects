# marissa_projects
An assortment of past schoolwork and side projects. I didn't organize my ACME labs very well at the time so now I'm not sure which ones came from which class, and this is probably not all of them.

My final project for CS 401R was self-scoped, but I didn't create my own dataset for it or anything else here. The pandas visualization lab was a group project during senior year of undergrad, and I can't remember at this point which part of it I was in charge of.

The fitbit data stuff might get more fleshed out at some point. I got really excited at some point that I could get at the API and look at my sleep data, but I didn't have time to do much with it.
