# marissa_projects
An assortment of past schoolwork and side projects. The chances of all my miscellaneous ACME lab crap ever getting fully organized and put here are not great. I might work through all the labs again at some point, but that would go in its own repository.

My final project for CS 401R was self-scoped, but I didn't create my own dataset for it or anything else here. The pandas visualization lab was a group project during senior year of undergrad, and I can't remember at this point which part of it I was in charge of.

The fitbit data stuff might get more fleshed out at some point. I got really excited at some point that I could get at the API and look at my sleep data, but I didn't have time to do much with it.
